🛡️ Task 8: Working with VPNs
📌 Objective
Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and ensuring secure communication online.
🛠️ Tools Used
ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
Windscribe (Free Tier)
whatismyipaddress.com (to verify IP change)
🚀 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Choose a VPN Service
Signed up for ProtonVPN Free (alternative: Windscribe Free).
Created a free account using email verification.
2️⃣ Download & Install VPN Client
Downloaded ProtonVPN from the official site.
Installed on the system.
''' bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install protonvpn
'''
3️⃣ Connect to a VPN Server
Logged into ProtonVPN client.
Selected the closest available free server.
Successfully connected (status indicator showed active).
4️⃣ Verify IP Address Change
Checked IP on whatismyipaddress.com.
IP changed from ISP-assigned to VPN server IP.
5️⃣ Confirm Encrypted Traffic
Browsed websites while connected.
Traffic encrypted through VPN tunnel + HTTPS.
6️⃣ Disconnect & Compare
Disconnected from VPN.
IP reverted to ISP’s real IP.
Browsing speed slightly improved after disconnect.
7️⃣ Research on VPN Security
VPNs typically use AES-256 encryption with OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IKEv2/IPSec.
Prevents ISP tracking, unsafe public Wi-Fi interception, and IP-based tracking.
Free VPNs have limitations (speed, servers, possible logging).
📖 Summary
✅ Benefits
Encrypts all network traffic (safe on public Wi-Fi).
Masks real IP address → increases anonymity.
Bypasses geo-blocks and censorship.
Stops ISP from monitoring browsing.
⚠️ Limitations
Free plans = speed/data/server restrictions.
Some providers may log user data.
Encryption overhead can reduce performance.
VPN ≠ replacement for HTTPS or end-to-end encryption.
